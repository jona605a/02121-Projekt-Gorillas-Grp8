# Gorillas
This project is a modern version of an old game called Gorillas.

# Gameplay
Gorillas is a two-player game in which the players take turns trying to hit their opponent.
Hitting another player deals damage to them. The first player to lose all their health loses.
To throw a projectile you need to choose an angle and a velocity. To choose an angle you use your mouse's position. When you have adjusted the angle to your liking, hold down mouse click - this will trigger the aimline to slowly increase in length. Your projectile's velocity is based on how long you press your mouse button and is shown by the aimline increasing length.
